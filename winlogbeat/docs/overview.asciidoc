== Overview

Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to Elasticsearch or Logstash. It installs as
a Windows service on all versions of Windows since XP.

Winlogbeat reads from one or more event logs (e.g. Application or System),
filters the events based on user configured criteria, then sends the event data
to the configured outputs (e.g. Elasticsearch or Logstash). It watches the event
logs so that new event data is sent in a timely manner. The read position for
each event log is persisted to disk to allow Winlogbeat to resume after
restarts.

Winlogbeat is a https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[Beat], and it is based on
the libbeat framework. The general configuration options for libbeat and how to
setup Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana are covered in the
{libbeat}/index.html[Beats Platform Reference].
