== Configuration Options

Before modifying configuration settings, make sure you've read
<<topbeat-configuration>>.

The Topbeat configuration file uses http://yaml.org/[YAML] for its syntax.
The file contains config options common to all Beats. These options are described
in the following sections of the {libbeat}/configuration.html[Beats Platform Reference]:

* {libbeat}/configuration.html#configuration-shipper[Shipper]
* {libbeat}/configuration.html#configuration-output[Output]
* {libbeat}/configuration.html#configuration-logging[Logging (Optional)]
* {libbeat}/configuration.html#configuration-run-options[Run Options (Optional)]

The Topbeat config options are described here:

* <<configuration-input>>


[[configuration-input]]
=== Input

The `input` section specifies how often Topbeat reads server statistics and which
statistics it captures. Here is an example configuration:

[source,yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
input:
  # In seconds, defines how often to read server statistics
  period: 10

  # Regular expression to match the processes that are monitored
  # By default, all the processes are monitored
  procs: [".*"]

  # Statistics to collect (all enabled by default)
  stats:
    system: true
    proc: true
    filesystem: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Options

You can specify the following options in the `input` section:

===== period

How often, in seconds, to read system-wide and per-process statistics from your servers. The default is 10.

===== procs

A list of regular expressions to match all the processes that need to be monitored. By
default, all the running processes are monitored.

===== stats

The statistics to collect. You can specify the following settings:

* `system: true` to capture system-wide statistics, including statistics about
system load, CPU usage, memory usage, and swap usage.
* `proc: true` to capture per-process statistics, such as the process name,
parent pid, state, pid, CPU usage, and memory usage.
* `filesystem: true` to capture file system statistics, including details about the
mounted disks, such as the total and used disk space, and details about each
disk, such as the device name and the mounting place.
